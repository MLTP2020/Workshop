# Workshop on Exuberance of Machine Learning in Transport Phenomena
# mltp2020.github.io

With the success of Machine Learning (ML) in computer vision, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and many other disciplines, it is not surprising to witness its popularity within the computational science and engineering community. Both conventional machine learning and the state of the art deep learning methods have proven effective in transport phenomena, and it is expected that the rate of progress would be even faster in the near future.

The objective of this workshop is to assess the state of progress in development, implementation and application of ML in transport phenomena. Of particular interest are applications in fluid dynamics, including turbulence, heat & mass transfer, multi-phase flows, biological transport, combustion and other reactive flows. Considering the complexity of such phenomena, the question is to what to expect from ML and to what extend such learnings can assist in modeling and inference of transport phenomena.

Distinguished scholars with expertise in both machine learning and transport phenomena of these fields are invited to discuss their recent results, and to identify the paths to be taken in future to merge ML into modeling of transport phenomena.
